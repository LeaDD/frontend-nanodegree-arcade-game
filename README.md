### How to Play

The object of the game is to maneuver your **avatar** across the brick path to the water while avoiding collisions with the **bugs**. This is accomplished by using the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the avatar up, down, left and right. Successfully reaching the water will result in the player being awarded 50 points. Each collision with a bug will result in a penalty of 10 points.

In addition there will be **gems** placed at random on the game board. Maneuver the avatar over each of these gems to receive a 100 point bonus.
