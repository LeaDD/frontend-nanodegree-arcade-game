### How to Play

The object of the game is to maneuver your **avatar** across the brick path to the water while avoiding collisions with the **bugs**. Successfully reaching the water will result in the player being awarded 50 points. Each collision with a bug will result in a penalty of 10 points.

In addition there will be **gems** placed at random on the game board. Maneuver the avatar over each of these gems to receive a 100 point bonus.
